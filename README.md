# Flamengo-card-deck
I created an api that serves some data from Flamengo, my favourite football / soccer team.
Then in the frontend i created cards that shows all the players informations.

### Build with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- NODE ( EXPRESS )

### What I Learned:
- Generate html element from json data.
- Array map, reduce, filter and sort.
- Using Express to create a server and api.
- Modules.
- Nodemon.
